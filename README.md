The second app I ever wrote for Android was Chatman Soundboard.
Somehow the code for the 1.4 version was lost.
The app still worked but had no way to change theme without the menu button.
This is a patched version to add a theme selection button above the list of sounds.
In order to do so I found a copy of my old app as an APK on Google and then applied
similar techniques for making hacked/cracked/patched apps using [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)


For my first experiences learning Android development look at:
